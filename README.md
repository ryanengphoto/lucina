# Lucina

Lucina is a retro inspired single-player first-person horror game that focuses on collecting mementos and avoiding monsters and death.

This repo contains all code and unity projects related to the Lucina project for CAP 4053 AI for Game Programming in Spring of 2025.

## Contribution
Cloning and opening the project in Unity will result in initial errors in the console. These can be fixed first by importing all required asset packs (listed below) and then fixing some of the errors within those asset packs. In Flooded Grounds, there appears an error related to the `minAttribute` reference in one of the scripts; this should be fixed by changing the reference to an explicit `UnityPostProcessing.minAttribute` refernce. The prefabs in the cartoon sign pack must be changed to use normal shaders. 

## Known Bugs
* Some lights cause more to light up than their expected radius
* Angels act as if you can't see them even if they're partially obscured

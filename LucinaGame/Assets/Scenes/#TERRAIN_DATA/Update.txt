    1.  The blue hue is a fog effect I added
        to get rid of it if u dont like just go to:
            window->rendering->lighting->environment
            then deselect the fog button
    2.  The pixel look/ PS1 graphics is weird to turn off
        just message me to get rid of it/ change it


If u touch the speed of player movement the animations & sounds will be off
